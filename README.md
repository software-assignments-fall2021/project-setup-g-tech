## Description of the Project 
Every year about 40 million tons of food in the United States ends up in landfills. This equates to approximately 40% of the entire US food supply ([source](https://www.rts.com/resources/guides/food-waste-america/)). Restaurants and other food businesses are big contributors to these numbers as, at the end of the day, there is bound to be leftover food that inevitably goes to waste. <br/> 

Therefore, this project is built to be an extensive and dynamic marketplace with restaurants, bakeries, cafes and other businesses in the food industry. It serves to any food suppliers and to anyone else with access to the internet as a consumer. It will allow for food business to log any food items that are available with them, and would rather go to waste, to be viewed by the general population that could potentially consume it to reduce wastage.

## History of the Project & How to Contribute 
### History 
As study away students on a tight budget, we have to manage our budgets very carefully. On top of that, we watched two instances of food wastage unfold infront of us which made us want to develop an application which could benefit everyone simultaneously. <br/>

In only our first week in New York, as we embarked on our search for Halal Food, we came across a restaurant called Holy Cow. As we finished up our meal, the restaurant owner reached out to us with an offer to take 3 burgers, if we wish to, for free. Upon inquiry, since the free offer came off as a surprise, the owner told us that someone had placed an order but they never showed up to receive it. As the food may have gone to waste otherwise, we were offered without any charge.<br/>

Only a week later after the aforementioned case, we arrived at a 7 Eleven franchise looking for Pizzas. However, we were met with another surprise as the attendee informed us that they had trashed the pizzas only a few minutes back since no came to pick them up. <br/>

At this point, we wished there was a platform that provides accessibility to the general population with an opportunity to receive and consume food that would otherwise go to waste. This would help reduce the wastage of food, as well as allow restaurants to rather sell the food for a very discounted price to cover the losses, or even give it away for free. It branches opportunities like those of immediate consumption for even shelf items that are closing to expiry. <br/>
